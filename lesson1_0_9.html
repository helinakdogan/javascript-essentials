<!--
    var vs let vs const

    * var
    - function scoped
    - allows to redeclare variables
    - allows to reassign within scope
    - hoisting occurs in var

    * let
    - block-scoped	                    
    - does not allow to redeclare variables 
    - allows to reassign within scope
    - hoisting does not occur in let	            

    * const
    - block-scoped	 
    - does not allow to redeclare variables 
    - does not allow to reassign within scope
    - hoisting does not occur in let
